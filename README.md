This is one of my first CS project. I did a game of ping pong in my Freshman year as a college freshman in C. But it was not that efficient and works with only MS DOS supported compilers. So in my sophomore year I am rebuilding it again in Java Swing. I am also adding a cool feature which is playing aganist AI.Hope you like it.
